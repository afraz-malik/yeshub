There is a considerable amount of tools and instruments for the analysis of market opportunities for youth employment and entrepreneurship.and the identification of relevant curricula for specific boys and girls. Plan has combined some ideas and elements from these existing tools into a market scan methodology to save time and resources for the identification and development of YEE projects. In addition, an additional challenge was raised to improve the integration of gender aspects in this market scan and in this toolbox you can find a rapid market scan instrument with a gender perspective. In this framework, it is also recommended to include, depending on specific contexts, an analysis of inclusion and job opportunities for minority groups such as Lesbian, Gay, Transgender and Bisexual (LGTB) or ethnic minorities.",

This population has to be specified by sex, age, ethnicity and other relevant characteristics for the context in which the future project is framed. Although YEE projects focus on youth, this can be divided into adolescents (13-17 years), recent youth (18-25 years) and older youth (25-35 years).`,

These people may be in the unemployed group, but not necessarily. Special attention must be given to girls and young women in general, and indigenous women in particular, since there are several who are not even looking for work (and therefore do not enter the unemployment data) due to the obstacles they face (such as, for example, caring for your children or rejection of being pregnant). Other groups that are often “forgotten” are people who belong to the LGBTIQ community, people with a disability or single women.

 

                            Once the project's target group has been defined, a mapping of other potential stakeholders or collaborators must be made, such as:
                            
                            Professional Technical Training (FTP) institutions that offer or could offer the necessary curricula,
                            companies that could hire these people,
                            government entities that have the responsibility of providing the regulatory framework or related public services,
                            academic institutions that can conduct research on the sector with a gender perspective,
                            non-governmental, peasant or community-based organizations that can mobilize and promote activities with the target population.
                            The mapping of possible FTP instances as an associate of your YEE project must include a diagnosis of their capacities with a gender perspective in order to identify the most appropriate (public, private or social sector) to be strengthened with the project and serve the population. selected beneficiary. This diagnosis has to identify the instances that have the capacity and the will to successfully train young people in the required vocational and technical skills identified in the market analysis. Likewise, it has to identify the key issues for the strengthening of the most appropriate instances (public, private or social sector) in terms of, for example, improvement of their training facilities, provision of machinery, introduction of improvements to training modules. training,
                            
                             
                            
                            The mapping of multiple actors from the private, public, academic and civil society sectors is key to identify the strategic alliances that can be developed from the beginning of the project in order to achieve the sustainability of the results generated (see also stages 7 and 8).`,

                Depending on the results of the market analysis, the identification and mobilization of the target group in Stages 1 to 3, the desired level of educational qualification and the design of the courses must be decided to be aligned with the qualification and certification frameworks. of government institutions . Various course possibilities can be considered, for example a mixed range of long and short courses leading to different levels of certification. Depending on the applicable qualification framework, both formal and non-formal training designs can be chosen that allow apprenticeship, work, work-apprenticeship, or other custom designs.
                
                 
                
                The FTP curriculum offering must be relevant and aligned with the needs of:
                
                Young men and women
                The private sector that hires program students in decent work jobs.
                In addition, the participation of the private sector will be required in the development and validation of the curricula.
                
                 
                
                In curriculum development, an important aspect to consider is how to break gender stereotypes and gender discrimination in TVET. For this, it is important to work on sensitizing young men and women, as well as educators and future employers, and especially addressing the awareness of young women about their rights, gender stereotypes and power relations and stimulating their empowerment. In the planning and delivery of curricula, it is also important to allow the participation of young women in the design of educational programs and activities. In this sense, it is also important to pay attention to the stereotypes of other groups such as LGTB and ethnic minorities.
                
                People who have an entrepreneurial profile, apart from being motivated, need to have a good level of self-esteem and empowerment (economic and social) to be able to face the risks and insecurity related to entrepreneurship. These factors are crucial to the success and sustainability of young people's business initiatives. Therefore, identifying the aptitude and talent for entrepreneurship  is the first step to be able to identify the people who can follow the path to entrepreneurship as the first choice of preference.
                
                To awaken interest for entrepreneurship, a sample about what entrepreneurship is can be offered to FTP education students. The development curriculum for entrepreneurship requires content and suitable methodologies to prepare students to face the dynamics of the business world, to accept and manage risk and uncertainty related to entrepreneurship and to develop the ability to make decisions and leadership required for the business management. Curricula should include specific attention to female entrepreneurship to awaken the interest of women and equip them to face entrepreneurship-related challenges that are regularly greater than those faced by men.`,

                    mainContent: `The strategy with a gender transformative approach of the YEE project is developed based on the data generated in the gender analysis of Stage 1. The strategy has to go beyond ensuring that women and men benefit equally from the project.

                    In order to develop gender transformative interventions, the relationship between project activities and processes and the transformation of traditional gender roles must be recognized. Likewise, it is necessary to understand what a transformative approach to gender is and how it relates to other, more accommodating gender approaches. The gender equity criteria developed by Plan show a matrix ranging from No gender recognition, gender neutral, gender conscious and finally with a transformative gender approach.
                    
                    The matrix and other tools available in this toolbox help identify where your YEE project strategy is at and where it should be heading. The ideal is to achieve the transformation of gender roles and relationships, but it may be necessary to first start with creating gender awareness before moving forward.
                    
                    In all documentation developed within the framework of the project (from the proposal, theory of change, strategy with a gender perspective, progress reports, training curricula, etc.) an inclusive language must be used , and there is a variety of models and tools to such an end.
                    
                    The mainstreaming of a gender perspective ( gender mainstreaming , GM) is a strategy that integrates both the needs and experiences of women as men in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of projects YEE. It can include transformative or gender-aware approaches or a combination of both. Strategies with a gender perspective (GM) must be specific with objectives, activities, budgets, etc. In addition, it is necessary to understand the definitions of gender, create a joint vision for gender equality and develop the appropriate strategy. This section contains some examples of methodologies frequently used in Latin America (see also section 1.3).
                    
                    Gender mainstreaming is not only relevant in preparing for salaried employment but also for entrepreneurship, including in rural areas. This section also presents some strategies to incorporate a gender perspective in the agricultural value chain that can be used to support young people's entrepreneurships or cooperatives in rural areas (see also section 1.3).`,

                        `The strategy with a gender transformative approach must have sufficient human and financial resources to be able to execute it. This includes developing the budgets of the YEE project (as well as of the FTP institutions, companies and other entities) with a gender perspective. The budgets with a gender approach is developed based on gender analysis and defined strategy, and should be aimed at an equitable distribution of resources. These resources refer to financial resources, material resources (computers, infrastructure) as well as human resources. The gender budget does not only mean a differentiated use by gender of certain funds but also focuses on the interaction of expenditures with other resources.`,
                        `Developing budgets with a gender approach refers to the process of conceiving, planning, approving, executing, monitoring, analyzing and auditing budgets in a gender-sensitive manner. It involves the analysis of the actual expenses and income (of the project, a company, FTP institution or other instance) in women and girls compared to the expenses in men and boys. It helps to decide how the objectives and strategies of the projects should be formulated and is a tool for the effective implementation of projects since it allows to verify if the assignments are in line with the objectives and strategies in order to obtain the desired impact.`,
                        `The specific budget or the proportion of the general budget of the FTP project / institution / company, which should be allocated to gender activities depends on the strategy developed. Furthermore, budgets are often intertwined, as not only will gender-specific activities be developed, but already planned activities can also be made more gender-sensitive (for example, by setting a quota for women's participation).`,

These participatory processes are time consuming as they lay the foundation for intensive collaboration throughout the project period and, at best, well beyond (see also section 1.4).`,

                    mainContent: `For interventions to be effective, the gender perspective must be integrated not only within the program but also at the internal institutional level of the actors involved, through policies, strategies, work tools, training, and other gender structures within the entities ( companies and institutions). The actors involved are structured according to gender relations and norms in the surrounding society and (re) produce existing gender inequalities. Therefore, the gender mainstreaming strategy must include both actions at the programmatic level and at the internal institutional level. The latter must be implemented and monitored by each entity individually. Program activities are monitored globally.

                    The creation of public - private alliances or cooperation with multiple stakeholders ( multi-stakeholder cooperation) and the establishment of networks is essential to ensure the success of entrepreneurship and youth social innovation in Latin America and must be considered from the beginning when designing a YEE project. The management of gender transformative alliances must consider at least the following three areas, and must consider the gender sensitivity of:
                    
                    Instances of FTP to ensure the quality of the training offer (FTP) with a gender transforming approach;
                    Government bodies to ensure coordination with other projects and compliance with State requirements and policies;
                    Private sector to ensure the relevance of the training offer (FTP) and other support activities for the employment of youth, as well as to ensure gender sensitive work environments.`,
                    subContents: [
                        `Gender-sensitive companies / institutions must be identified or, at a minimum, open to entering into a staff awareness and institutional strengthening process to develop the capacity to promote a gender-sensitive workplace or education with equal opportunities and benefits for women and men. One way to convince companies is to make them understand that greater equality will translate into more profits and better business ( greater equality = better business). Having more diverse teams also results in improved performance. One factor may be that diverse teams bring together multiple perspectives, allowing for a more holistic analysis of problems encountered at work. In addition, companies open to greater diversity in their staff are more likely to take advantage of the talents available in different population groups in terms of gender, ethnicity, age, and so on.`,
                        `Based on the development opportunities identified in the market scan and gender analysis, it is recommended to include in the design the management of alliances with companies in the region. On the one hand, to open spaces for articulation with production units that, due to their level of progress and consolidation, can be integrated into new markets, becoming providers of services, supplies of raw materials or products that allow increasing business opportunities. On the other hand, in relation to the employability component, to establish alliances for the employment of young people who will participate in the project. Specifically, conferences or business meetings can be sponsored for this purpose.`,
                        `Every company and institution must have and implement a formal policy regarding gender equality, and include it in the reports on human resources. A gender-sensitive work policymust provide: A nondiscrimination clause; Equal opportunities with respect to hiring, remuneration, promotion, training; Quotas of women in decision-making positions; Maternity and paternity leave; Flexible work hours; Access to child care; Gender-sensitive facilities, such as separate bathrooms, breastfeeding spaces; Safety and health, including policies against sexual harassment and an objective professional person to speak to. However, more is needed than developing formal policies and rules regarding gender: awareness and skills of staff and management must be worked on so that they are truly implemented and respected.

                        The info-story on the gender gap in employment is recommended: what slows the advancement of women? ( www.ilo.org/infostories/es-ES/Stories/Employment/barriers-women#global-gap ) as learning or to be used in awareness-raising work with potential employer companies and other key stakeholders.`,

                    Here you can find instruments for the identification of dropout  risks that young people may face in the different stages of the YEE project and to assess their probability and impact, and identify actions to mitigate them. An analysis differentiated by gender, identifying specific risks that affect young women and men, allows a better focus on mitigation actions.
                    
                    The risks young people face can lead to desertion from the project. Instruments and technical guidelines for the retention of young people  aim to promote comprehensive quality in continuous improvement as a process of change and educational transformation in institutional and pedagogical practices. It also allows the development and strengthening of capacities in the educational actors themselves, in the generation of collaboration networks between teachers and study centers, in the leadership of the directive and technical teams, as well as for the definition of strategic lines of prevention of school dropout .
                    
                    One of the key aspects to prevent desertion is the accompaniment of the participants. Therefore, it is recommended to keep a record of the accompaniment activities for young people, and the commitments and agreements that result from this accompaniment. This should include the involvement of the family or other people related to the young people. If the family is aware of the project and of the commitments and benefits for the young person, the retention percentage is higher.
                    
                    Some other recommendations are: Zoning technical vocational training , locating the training in a central place between 3 to 4 communities to facilitate the participation of young men and women, and at the same time avoid training in the same place too many people with the same competencies saturating the local market. Likewise, constant monitoring of youth participation must be carried out (see also Stage 9 of Monitoring and Evaluation).
                    
                     
                    
                    Specific strategies to ensure the inclusion and retention of vulnerable women and youth are important to ensure that your YEE project can benefit these groups to the same extent as men. The following actions are recommended to achieve a majority participation of adolescent and young women in YEE projects:
                    
                    Involve and commit the young woman's family and partner in the sensitization process so that they provide the necessary support for their participation in the project.
                    Organize focus groups with young women on the limitations and conditions necessary to participate in the project and develop actions to facilitate their participation.
                    Address the particular needs of young women with children, providing benefits for care, early stimulation projects for children from 0 to 3 years, allowance for travel expenses, among others.
                    Choose spaces where there are childcare services, such as schools where Plan already has childcare activities for children, to facilitate proper care for mothers and babies.
                    Organize activities in daylight hours and a short distance from the community. Plan the time and frequency of the trainings in order to allow young women with children to participate.
                    Secure transportation if possible or provide training on transportation security measures. In case of events (employment forums, youth leaders forum), rent transportation for participants.
                    Research and offer technical training on income generation options that produce added value or access to quality employment specifically for women.
                    Incorporate life skills training: self-esteem, empowerment, gender equality, sexual and reproductive health, new masculinities and life project, which allow generating awareness in young people in terms of gender roles, and creating capacities in terms making decisions about your own life (see Stage 4).
                    Include psychosocial support in the project.
                    In areas of social violence, it is necessary to organize spaces for reflection among the young participants to face the conditions of violence and the identification of alternatives to face them. Special attention must be paid to gender-based violence. In these areas, it is important to also take the following actions:
                    
                    Preparation of maps of risks and social violence and maintain permanent updating.
                    Involvement of key actors in the project. In the case of El Salvador, local governments have been a relevant factor for the inclusion of young people in areas with a high incidence of violence; They have provided complementary resources for the implementation of the project.
                    Support during the processes of awareness, convocation and execution of the project in community-based organizations and community leaders.
                    Previous individual and group work is suggested to bring these people (who face situations of violence) closer to the project, promoting their leading role, providing them with volunteer roles and facilitating their self-esteem (see also Stage 4).
                    Bring the project services closer to the communities or to places, schedules and means of transport that provide safe conditions, in which young people can move without suffering any harm, physical or verbal aggression.
                    Implement methodologies such as those of savings and credit groups, in order to generate trust among its participants and the social fabric.`,

This also includes understanding your sexual orientation. It involves knowing human and youth rights, but also recognizing that women and men and LGTB people face different obstacles to be able to enjoy them; In many cases, women face greater barriers than men, both in their daily life and at work.`,

Therefore, it is important to encourage boys and young men to get involved and engage in the redistribution of power in their personal lives and in public spheres. Young men must be encouraged to be advocates and agents of change for the achievement of gender equality and women's rights.

                    At the same time, it is necessary to work on the empowerment of girls and young women so that they too are defenders and agents of change . They have to know their rights; recognize your strengths and weaknesses; develop their self-esteem so that they lose their fear of public speaking and begin to participate actively, solving problems and taking control over their own lives. In short, they have to learn to make decisions with autonomy and self-worth about aspects that affect their own life, and establish agency and power. at the three levels indicated in Plan's gender equality criteria (see section 2.3): “power over” (having authority), “power within” (having the confidence to claim their rights) and “power with” (collaborating with other people to achieve collective goals).
                    
                    Empowerment is also the foundation of leadership . Once young women have developed the personal skills to be leaders in their own lives, they can also acquire the skills to be leaders at work. This requires the ability to create a vision, develop strategies to achieve it, seek potential allied stakeholders, and communicate with others (see also section 2.2 on developing a gender-sensitive strategy).`,

An imbalance of power in mentoring and mentoring relationships can easily distort the results of these processes. That is why it is important to raise awareness and train tutors and mentors in handling aspects of power, gender and age, in the orientation and mentoring process (see also section 2.4).

                        In the selection of tutors / mentors, their sensitivity to gender issues must be taken into account , but also their gender itself, since the use of tutors / mentors (women) can generate trust among female students / interns / employers.`,
                        `Another form of accompaniment is labor intermediation , which can be carried out by tutors or mentors, but also by other actors such as a public or private service. Intermediation may include the organization of job fairs or exchanges, the creation of a database on young people seeking employment and companies offering employment, or the direct establishment of contacts between young people and employers. Like mentoring and guidance, intermediation becomes more important in times of transition (for example, from school to technical training, from FTP to first job, from one job to another, but also at the time of having a job). son / daughter).`,

These interviews can be very frequent at the beginning, specifically during the probationary period, and as the person has been on the job longer, the frequency can decrease up to once a year.

One aspect of these services is the application of non-discrimination mechanisms at work and ensuring that men and women have equal opportunities to find work with equitable payments. In some cases, affirmative actions (positive discrimination) can also be considered to improve access to work for women, ethnic groups, people with disabilities or young people and break stereotypes.

 

                    Labor mediation also includes services for students and postgraduates in managing a database of jobs, support in mediation and hiring, in matters of insurance and social benefits, etc.

At the same time, it is necessary to improve the understanding of although CSR may involve an additional cost for the company, it has been shown that in the long term it represents clear economic and corporate benefits, better profitability and sustainability for companies.`,

                        `C: Monitoring survey to training institution and partner companies aims to collect, in an organized and standardized way, information on project performance indicators through a survey of partner entities (educational institutions, companies and / or public entities that provide employment or internships for young people) to improve the intervention and results of the project. It is recommended to include questions differentiated by gender to be able to capture differences in the performance of women and men in order to adjust the intervention strategy of the project from a gender equity perspective.`,
                        `D: Satisfaction interview with young people and allied entities , which aims to explore the satisfaction and perceptions of the different actors participating in the YEE project, through an individual or group interview. The interview is a complement to the monitoring survey of young people and partner entities (instrument B and C) and is intended to generate a more qualitative analysis of the project's intervention to provide feedback and improve it. The interview guide is accompanied by an informed consent form that is read and signed by the person interviewed.`,
                        `E: Youth characterization and monitoring matrix. The information is systematized and feeds the main indicators of the YEE LATAM monitoring system. For the purposes of your YEE project indicators, review the indicators used by your organization and those defined in the baseline study to facilitate project monitoring and evaluation.`,
                        `When designing indicators, it should be clear how the information that measures the achievement of the indicator can be collected. This can be done through quantitative methods, such as surveys, or qualitative methods, such as interviews and focus groups. To ensure that the indicators are objectively verifiable they have to be SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and realistic over time). Checklists can be used for the definition of objectively verifiable indicators included in this toolbox.

                        Some recommendations for the M&E process are:
                        
                        Clearly define the output, outcome, and impact indicators according to the project's logical framework or theory of change.
                        Indicate the disaggregations for each indicator (minimum by sex, but it can also be by age, community, etc.), source of indicator information, institution responsible for providing indicator data, recommended measurement frequency, and observations on data quality.
                        Disaggregate all the information by sex in order to allow an analysis from a gender perspective.
                        Develop a user-friendly information management system that allows standardizing and optimizing the procedures for measuring, storing and managing the information of the different project indicators.
                        Hire a specialist person to follow up on the monitoring and evaluation system.
                        As an aspect of vital importance to guarantee the success of the relationship with vocational training entities, a strategy of delivery and permanent control of the information must be generated, which allows monitoring the scope of the products and handling of the relevant information of young people. participants.
                        In the monitoring surveys of project partner entities, training institutions and companies that provide employment, ask questions differentiated by sex in order to capture differences in the performance of women and men in order to adjust the project intervention strategy from a perspective of genre.
                        Plan has developed YES! Me, which is a digital monitoring system for the registration and follow-up of the participants of a YEE project. The system can monitor young people for up to 6 years after their participation in the project. Similarly, the system collects information to measure the impact of the project at the individual level as well as by groups.

Changes in (1) the conditions and positions of women and men (individually and comparatively), who participate in vocational training, employment or an enterprise within a value chain, including income, should be monitored; (2) gender relations, such as the division of labor according to gender, access to and control over resources and information, decision-making, among others, and (3) the attitudes and perceptions of women and men. Gender-sensitive M&E should not only collect gender data, `,

                        `Gender should be addressed in ongoing monitoring and during evaluations for the same reasons that we address other issues: when assessing whether an activity is achieving its objectives, we can consider what has been achieved and what can be learned and feedback in additional efforts. If results are not evaluated against gender strategies and interventions, they are unlikely to receive attention during project implementation.`,
                        `Gender-sensitive M&E in a results-based framework reveals the extent to which the project has achieved improvements in the social and economic well-being of women and men. It also helps improve project performance during implementation, facilitates mid-term adjustments, and helps draw lessons for future projects, for example by detecting and addressing gender-based constraints.`,
                        `Individual empowerment interventions without considering the people in their environment (at work, but also in their home or community) and the gender relations between them, can fail. Gender M&E can identify unintended consequences and opportunities for real empowerment of young people, especially women. By demonstrating the impacts of interventions for both women and men, these data can be used to improve decision-making, strategies, and interventions in such a way that gender imbalances are overcome and equitable development occurs, benefiting young people. genders, age groups and ethnicities.

                        Design an M&E system with a gender perspective
                        
                        Gender should be included from the beginning of the project and in the design of the monitoring plan or system. If a monitoring framework already exists (such as a logical framework or theory of change), the gender approach should be integrated. This involves reviewing all indicators, targets, results, data collection methods, etc. for their gender responsiveness and adding gender-sensitive indicators, results, and methods if necessary. Ideally, this is done in an integrated way, from the start of a project. If gender has not been taken into account at the project design stage, it will most likely not be taken into account during implementation either. Integrating a gender approach can be done with any monitoring framework, including Theory of Change or Pathways of Impact.`,
                        `The goals, purposes or objectives of the project should explicitly refer to gender or reflect the needs and priorities of women as well as those of men. The monitoring and evaluation strategy for the interventions should specify the expected gender outcomes. These can be formulated at various levels: at the individual, household, market, business, community, and even political and macro levels. The gender analysis and the baseline with a gender approach during the project design stage (stage 2) should provide relevant information for the development of the gender-sensitive M&E system.`,
                        `During implementation, gender analysis (see stage 1 for reference documents) is used to monitor the results of interventions on men and women, gender relations and the position of women. It is recommended to measure benefits and adverse effects on men and women separately whenever possible, and check if the needs and interests of women and men are still being taken into consideration during implementation.`,
                        `M&E should reflect gender complexities and changes taking place at different levels: policies, laws, resource allocation, social structures, culture, beliefs and practices. It is necessary to include the context in which the status of women is improved and the temporal dynamics, for example, if gender gaps have been reduced and to what extent empowerment processes have taken place over time. It is crucial to focus on different types of impacts, including economic, social, cultural, political, and psychological impacts.`,
                        `M&E must be participatory and involve women and men, as well as the different actors involved in the project. The combination of qualitative and quantitative data collection tools is useful for capturing different dimensions of the impacts achieved.`,
                        `The report should address gender-related findings, both the results of gender mainstreaming in the overall project context, the results of the project's interventions on men, women, and gender relations, as well as the lessons learned from implementation. . Gender impacts should not be included in a separate section, but should be integrated into each section of the report.`,
                        `Institutional structures and guidelines are needed to support good gender oversight at the national, local and program levels. Insist that project staff and other stakeholders make specific and adequately detailed references to gender in supervision forms, progress reports, and other project documents. Document any gender differences, even when not mentioned in the project logframe. Make sure staff have the skills or obtain the necessary training and tools to understand gender and the importance of monitoring. Gender experts must be included for M&E.`,
                        `Development of indicators and targets with a gender perspective

                        Gender-sensitive indicators must be developed at all levels, not only at the level of outputs and results, but also, and most of all, at the level of impact. That is, it does not have to focus only on the measurement of numbers and products, such as an increase in the participation of women in training and employment, but rather pay attention to the intensity, quality and remuneration of their participation, especially to the real benefits in terms of social and economic empowerment, and in reducing gender-based inequalities.
                        
                         
                        
                        To be gender sensitive, indicators must:
                        
                        Require the collection of information disaggregated by sex whenever possible about who participates and benefits;
                        Assess whether the project has different benefits and impacts for men and women, and help us analyze why these differences occur between women and men;
                        Evaluate if the project is producing a change in gender relations, and help us analyze how gender relations are changing (positively or negatively) and how this impacts on the achievement of the general objectives of the project; and
                        Involve women and men in the development of the indicators and in the collection and analysis of information.
                        `,
                        `It is recommended to use indicators that measure movement in positions (instead of counting numbers) and to measure changes in the levels of gender inequality, measuring, for example, the “change in the proportion of women in management positions” instead of the "Number of women hired for management positions."

                        Collection and use of sex-disaggregated data
                        
                        In order to conduct gender-sensitive monitoring and evaluation, sex-disaggregated data is required and must be collected continuously. During the market analysis, gender analysis and baseline (see stages 1 and 2), the data collection should already be disaggregated by sex. When analyzing the collected data, the results and perceptions must be differentiated for women and men, and the project must aim to understand the differences, explain them and formulate responses.`,
                        `Sex (or gender) disaggregated data is data related to individuals that is collected, analyzed and presented separately for men and women. It is also recommended to disaggregate by age and, in some cases, by other variables, such as ethnic origin, marital status, sexual identity, etc. Collecting data disaggregated by sex and other variables can greatly inform YEE project initiatives, improve implementation (working with the most appropriate beneficiaries), and lead to a more effective monitoring and evaluation process (e.g. defining gender sensitive indicators to assess who benefits or does not benefit, how and why).`,
                        `Men and women are not homogeneous groups, and it is important to recognize their diversity in terms of economic class, ethnicity, religion and other characteristics, as well as individual preferences and abilities. These diversities should also be taken into account when collecting and analyzing data, for example by breaking down the data further. There are detailed guides on collecting and analyzing gender-disaggregated data for rural development projects.`,
                        `A systematic process for collecting sex-disaggregated data should include asking gender questions as part of the research design, developing sex-disaggregation tools for the indicators of interest, collecting information from men and women, and analyzing the data to understand the differences. and gender similarities.`,
                        `In addition, to collect the information, the most convenient places and times for young women and men must be taken into account. Likewise, it must be taken into account that much of women's work is invisible and unpaid, so a greater effort must be made to identify it and see how it is linked to visible and paid work in order to create clarity about the workload of both genders. It is always recommended to start with questions that are easier and more manageable for young people to build confidence before moving on to more sensitive and complex questions.`,

They focus on results (or changes) and the process of change: what has been achieved, how, by whom and what has been the contribution of the intervention or project. The changes are first identified by the people who implement (or implemented) the intervention and these will be validated by other stakeholders who can identify more or different changes. Finally, all parties must agree to the identified changes, the contribution and their importance. This makes the statements more objective.

                    Methodologies to systematize experiences in YEE projects, generally have 4 stages:
                    
                    Planning: where you work with the team in charge of systematization in creating the bases for the following stages to develop harmoniously and within the framework established by the work plan.
                    Reconstruction : here the information from documents generated in the projects involved is synthesized and ordered, the additional information that can be obtained through interviews or through focus groups.
                    Reflection: leads us to make a critical approach and a synthesis of experiences in order to enrich knowledge and / or produce new knowledge that will facilitate sustainable development.
                    Communication and dissemination: covers the process of preparing the base document, validation, preparation and implementation of specific communication products, which guarantee the dissemination of the results of the systematization in the target group, complying with the established objectives.`,

These types of cases can be used to convince decision makers from other companies and stakeholders to invest in the alliance with Plan for the economic empowerment of men and, especially, young women.
