Depending on the applicable qualification framework, both formal and non-formal training designs can be chosen that allow apprenticeship, work, work-apprenticeship, or other custom designs.\n                \n                 \n                \n                The FTP curriculum offering must be relevant and aligned with the needs of:\n                \n                Young men and women\n                The private sector that hires program students in decent work jobs.\n                In addition, the participation of the private sector will be required in the development and validation of the curricula.\n                \n                 \n                \n                In curriculum development, an important aspect to consider is how to break gender stereotypes and gender discrimination in TVET. For this, it is important to work on sensitizing young men and women, as well as educators and future employers, and especially addressing the awareness of young women about their rights, gender stereotypes and power relations and stimulating their empowerment. In the planning and delivery of curricula, it is also important to allow the participation of young women in the design of educational programs and activities. In this sense, it is also important to pay attention to the stereotypes of other groups such as LGTB and ethnic minorities.\n                \n                People who have an entrepreneurial profile, apart from being motivated, need to have a good level of self-esteem and empowerment (economic and social) to be able to face the risks and insecurity related to entrepreneurship. These factors are crucial to the success and sustainability of young people's business initiatives. Therefore, identifying the aptitude and talent for entrepreneurship  is the first step to be able to identify the people who can follow the path to entrepreneurship as the first choice of preference.\n                \n                To awaken interest for entrepreneurship, a sample about what entrepreneurship is can be offered to FTP education students. The development curriculum for entrepreneurship requires content and suitable methodologies to prepare students to face the dynamics of the business world, to accept and manage risk and uncertainty related to entrepreneurship and to develop the ability to make decisions and leadership required for the business management. Curricula should include specific attention to female entrepreneurship to awaken the interest of women and equip them to face entrepreneurship-related challenges that are regularly greater than those faced by men.`,\n                    subContents: [],\n                },\n                tools: [\n                    {\n                        id: 1,\n                        shortTitle: \"2.2.1 ILO_QualityApprenticeshipToolkit_I_Guide for Policy Makers_2017\",\n                        tools: [\n                            {\n                                id: 58,\n                                type: \"none\",\n                                original:\n                                    \"2.2.0 -

The strategy has to go beyond ensuring that women and men benefit equally from the project.\n\n                    In order to develop gender transformative interventions, the relationship between project activities and processes and the transformation of traditional gender roles must be recognized. Likewise, it is necessary to understand what a transformative approach to gender is and how it relates to other, more accommodating gender approaches. The gender equity criteria developed by Plan show a matrix ranging from No gender recognition, gender neutral, gender conscious and finally with a transformative gender approach.\n                    \n                    The matrix and other tools available in this toolbox help identify where your YEE project strategy is at and where it should be heading. The ideal is to achieve the transformation of gender roles and relationships, but it may be necessary to first start with creating gender awareness before moving forward.\n                    \n                    In all documentation developed within the framework of the project (from the proposal, theory of change, strategy with a gender perspective, progress reports, training curricula, etc.) an inclusive language must be used , and there is a variety of models and tools to such an end.\n                    \n                    The mainstreaming of a gender perspective ( gender mainstreaming , GM) is a strategy that integrates both the needs and experiences of women as men in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of projects YEE. It can include transformative or gender-aware approaches or a combination of both. Strategies with a gender perspective (GM) must be specific with objectives, activities, budgets, etc. In addition, it is necessary to understand the definitions of gender, create a joint vision for gender equality and develop the appropriate strategy. This section contains some examples of methodologies frequently used in Latin America (see also section 1.3).\n                    \n                    Gender mainstreaming is not only relevant in preparing for salaried employment but also for entrepreneurship, including in rural areas. This section also presents some strategies to incorporate a gender perspective in the agricultural value chain that can be used to support young people's entrepreneurships or cooperatives in rural areas (see also section 1.3).`,\n                    subContents: [\n                        `The strategy with a gender transformative approach must have sufficient human and financial resources to be able to execute it. This includes developing the budgets of the YEE project (as well as of the FTP institutions, companies and other entities) with a gender perspective. The budgets with a gender approach is developed based on gender analysis and defined strategy, and should be aimed at an equitable distribution of resources. These resources refer to financial resources, material resources (computers, infrastructure) as well as human resources. The gender budget does not only mean a differentiated use by gender of certain funds but also focuses on the interaction of expenditures with other resources.`,\n                        `Developing budgets with a gender approach refers to the process of conceiving, planning, approving, executing, monitoring, analyzing and auditing budgets in a gender-sensitive manner.

The actors involved are structured according to gender relations and norms in the surrounding society and (re) produce existing gender inequalities. Therefore, the gender mainstreaming strategy must include both actions at the programmatic level and at the internal institutional level. The latter must be implemented and monitored by each entity individually. Program activities are monitored globally.\n\n                    The creation of public - private alliances or cooperation with multiple stakeholders ( multi-stakeholder cooperation) and the establishment of networks is essential to ensure the success of entrepreneurship and youth social innovation in Latin America and must be considered from the beginning when designing a YEE project. The management of gender transformative alliances must consider at least the following three areas, and must consider the gender sensitivity of:\n                    \n                    Instances of FTP to ensure the quality of the training offer (FTP) with a gender transforming approach;\n                    Government bodies to ensure coordination with other projects and compliance with State requirements and policies;\n                    Private sector to ensure the relevance of the training offer (FTP) and other support activities for the employment of youth, as well as to ensure gender sensitive work environments.`,\n                    subContents: [\n                        `Gender-sensitive companies / institutions must be identified or, at a minimum, open to entering into a staff awareness and institutional strengthening process to develop the capacity to promote a gender-sensitive workplace or education with equal opportunities and benefits for women and men. One way to convince companies is to make them understand that greater equality will translate into more profits and better business ( greater equality = better business). Having more diverse teams also results in improved performance. One factor may be that diverse teams bring together multiple perspectives, allowing for a more holistic analysis of problems encountered at work. In addition, companies open to greater diversity in their staff are more likely to take advantage of the talents available in different population groups in terms of gender, ethnicity, age, and so on.`,\n                        `Based on the development opportunities identified in the market scan and gender analysis, it is recommended to include in the design the management of alliances with companies in the region. On the one hand, to open spaces for articulation with production units that, due to their level of progress and consolidation, can be integrated into new markets, becoming providers of services, supplies of raw materials or products that allow increasing business opportunities. On the other hand, in relation to the employability component, to establish alliances for the employment of young people who will participate in the project. Specifically, conferences or business meetings can be sponsored for this purpose.`,\n                        `Every company and institution must have and implement a formal policy regarding gender equality, and include it in the reports on human resources. A gender-sensitive work policymust provide: A nondiscrimination clause; Equal opportunities with respect to hiring, remuneration, promotion, training; Quotas of women in decision-making positions; Maternity and paternity leave; Flexible work hours; Access to child care; Gender-sensitive facilities, such as separate bathrooms, breastfeeding spaces; Safety and health, including policies against sexual harassment and an objective professional person to speak to. However, more is needed than developing formal policies and rules regarding gender: awareness and skills of staff and management must be worked on so that they are truly implemented and respected.\n\n                        The info-story on the gender gap in employment is recommended: what slows the advancement of women?

Instruments and technical guidelines for the retention of young people  aim to promote comprehensive quality in continuous improvement as a process of change and educational transformation in institutional and pedagogical practices. It also allows the development and strengthening of capacities in the educational actors themselves, in the generation of collaboration networks between teachers and study centers, in the leadership of the directive and technical teams, as well as for the definition of strategic lines of prevention of school dropout .\n                    \n                    One of the key aspects to prevent desertion is the accompaniment of the participants. Therefore, it is recommended to keep a record of the accompaniment activities for young people, and the commitments and agreements that result from this accompaniment. This should include the involvement of the family or other people related to the young people. If the family is aware of the project and of the commitments and benefits for the young person, the retention percentage is higher.\n                    \n                    Some other recommendations are: Zoning technical vocational training , locating the training in a central place between 3 to 4 communities to facilitate the participation of young men and women, and at the same time avoid training in the same place too many people with the same competencies saturating the local market. Likewise, constant monitoring of youth participation must be carried out (see also Stage 9 of Monitoring and Evaluation).\n                    \n                     \n                    \n                    Specific strategies to ensure the inclusion and retention of vulnerable women and youth are important to ensure that your YEE project can benefit these groups to the same extent as men. The following actions are recommended to achieve a majority participation of adolescent and young women in YEE projects:\n                    \n                    Involve and commit the young woman's family and partner in the sensitization process so that they provide the necessary support for their participation in the project.\n                    Organize focus groups with young women on the limitations and conditions necessary to participate in the project and develop actions to facilitate their participation.\n                    Address the particular needs of young women with children, providing benefits for care, early stimulation projects for children from 0 to 3 years, allowance for travel expenses, among others.\n                    Choose spaces where there are childcare services, such as schools where Plan already has childcare activities for children, to facilitate proper care for mothers and babies.\n                    Organize activities in daylight hours and a short distance from the community. Plan the time and frequency of the trainings in order to allow young women with children to participate.\n                    Secure transportation if possible or provide training on transportation security measures. In case of events (employment forums, youth leaders forum), rent transportation for participants.\n                    Research and offer technical training on income generation options that produce added value or access to quality employment specifically for women.\n                    Incorporate life skills training: self-esteem, empowerment, gender equality, sexual and reproductive health, new masculinities and life project, which allow generating awareness in young people in terms of gender roles, and creating capacities in terms making decisions about your own life (see Stage 4).\n                    Include psychosocial support in the project.\n                    In areas of social violence, it is necessary to organize spaces for reflection among the young participants to face the conditions of violence and the identification of alternatives to face them. Special attention must be paid to gender-based violence. In these areas, it is important to also take the following actions:\n                    \n                    Preparation of maps of risks and social violence and maintain permanent updating.\n                    Involvement of key actors in the project. In the case of El Salvador, local governments have been a relevant factor for the inclusion of young people in areas with a high incidence of violence; They have provided complementary resources for the implementation of the project.\n                    Support during the processes of awareness, convocation and execution of the project in community-based organizations and community leaders.\n                    Previous individual and group work is suggested to bring these people (who face situations of violence) closer to the project, promoting their leading role, providing them with volunteer roles and facilitating their self-esteem (see also Stage 4).\n                    Bring the project services closer to the communities or to places, schedules and means of transport that provide safe conditions, in which young people can move without suffering any harm, physical or verbal aggression.\n                    Implement methodologies such as those of savings and credit groups, in order to generate trust among its participants and the social fabric.`,\n                    subContents: [],\n                },\n                tools: [\n                    {\n                        id: 1,\n                        shortTtitle: \"3.3.1 Manual-Orientaciones-Retencion-Escolar\",\n                        tools: [\n                            {\n                                id: 132,\n                                type: \"none\",\n                                original: \"3.3.2 Manual-Orientaciones-Retencion-Escolar-1.pdf\",\n                                link: \"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A27%3A28.496Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf\",\n                            },\n                        ],\n                    },\n                    {\n                        id: 2,\n                        shortTitle: \"3.3.2 National Youth Employment Body Practice Guide_Brotherhood_2020\",\n                        tools: [\n                            {\n                                id: 133,\n                                type: \"none\",\n                                original:\n                                    \"3.3.4-3.1.3 National Youth Employment Body Practice Guide_Brotherhood_2020.pdf\",\n                                link: \"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A27%3A35.099Z0-homepage+-+Best+Practices+Guidelines+and+Toolkit+on+Engaging+the+Private+Sector+in+Skills+Development+-+P.pdf\",\n                            },\n                        ],\n                    },\n                ],\n            },\n            {\n                id: 4,\n                title: \"Mobilization of local actors\",\n                description: `The importance of mobilizing and allying with different actors that can be important partners for the YEE project has already been emphasized several times in this and previous stages.`,\n                image: stage3,\n                content: {\n                    mainContent: `n Stage 2 (in particular in section 2.3) we have already discussed the management of gender-sensitive alliances with companies and FTP institutions.

One modality is to establish and develop mentoring mechanisms among young women and men themselves. This is called ' peer review ' ( peer review ). The exchange of experiences between young people in practice can be a very strong support for individual students in the process of recognizing and facing challenges and solving practical problems. Gender aspects in education and work should also be touched on in this peer review, either in pairs or in groups of the same gender or in mixed groups.\n\n                    Another modality is the tutoring of students by their educators .

In the event that post-graduates do not continue their career in a work context (salaried employment) and opt for a career as an entrepreneur, this mentoring option by the employing company does not exist, but they can choose to continue the Peer review among entrepreneurs as colleagues and / or mentoring by external tutors may be considered. In addition, small and medium-sized enterprises can be involved in orientation programs.`,\n                        `In the counseling and mentoring process, gender and age relationships inherently introduce a challenge of keeping a balance of power. On the one hand, taking advantage of the accumulated experience of female or male tutors / mentors is necessary to accompany the person with less experience. On the other hand, tutors / mentors must ensure that the person who receives their support, follows an empowerment process that allows them to assume responsibility in making their own decisions. An imbalance of power in mentoring and mentoring relationships can easily distort the results of these processes. That is why it is important to raise awareness and train tutors and mentors in handling aspects of power, gender and age, in the orientation and mentoring process (see also section 2.4).\n\n                        In the selection of tutors / mentors, their sensitivity to gender issues must be taken into account , but also their gender itself, since the use of tutors / mentors (women) can generate trust among female students / interns / employers.`,\n                        `Another form of accompaniment is labor intermediation , which can be carried out by tutors or mentors, but also by other actors such as a public or private service. Intermediation may include the organization of job fairs or exchanges, the creation of a database on young people seeking employment and companies offering employment, or the direct establishment of contacts between young people and employers. Like mentoring and guidance, intermediation becomes more important in times of transition (for example, from school to technical training, from FTP to first job, from one job to another, but also at the time of having a job). son / daughter).`,\n                    ],\n                },\n                tools: [\n                    {\n                        id: 1,\n                        shortTitle: \"4.5.1 Digital-Skills-Toolkit\",\n                        tools: [\n                            {\n                                id: 167,\n                                type: \"none\",\n                                original: \"Digital-Skills-Toolkit.pdf\",\n                                link: \"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A33%3A01.848Z0-homepage+-+Best+Practices+Guidelines+and+Toolkit+on+Engaging+the+Private+Sector+in+Skills+Development+-+P.pdf\",\n                            },\n                        ],\n                    },\n                    {\n                        id: 2,\n                        shortTitle: \"4.5.2  Programa de Mentoria\",\n                        tools: [\n                            {\n                                id: 168,\n                                type: \"none\",\n                                original: \"4.5.2.1 Programa de Mentoria.pdf\",\n                                link: \"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A33%3A16.393Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf\",\n                            },\n                            {\n                                id: 169,\n                                type: \"none\",\n                                original: \"4.5.2.5 Guia Orientacion Socio-ocupacional_docentes_Bogota_2018.pdf\",\n                                link: \"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A33%3A20.425Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf\",\n                            },\n                            {\n                                id: 170,\n                                type: \"none\",\n                                original:\n                                    \"4.5.2.6 Secuencia Didactica Orientacion Socio-ocupacional_docentes_Min Edu Col_Dic 2015.pdf\",\n                                link: \"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A33%3A26.638Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf\",\n                            },\n                        ],\n                    },\n                    {\n                        id: 3,\n                        shortTitle: \"4.5.3 Engaging employers in Apprenticeships opportunities -
